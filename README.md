# Template for Kotlin projects
## Setup

In order to use this template you need to do the following steps:
1. modify project name in `settings.gradle.kts`
2. set up branch protection
3. set up a Personal Access token and modify it in the `release` job for `semantic release`([more here](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/recipes/ci-configurations/github-actions#pushing-package.json-changes-to-a-master-branch))
